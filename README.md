 Creational Design Patterns
 
 ### Singleton
 Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
 it can helps in some thing like settings , can be global to the whole project and access 
 from any where, and all other parts in the app have the same value 
 
 
 
 ## Warning
 
 a lot of developers now days avoid using singleton design pattern since it consume the memory 
 when you have a lot of them in your project, and they all kept in the memory until your program exit ,
